Instead of using the RemoteFormEntry the Sync Module could be used as a
replacement without introducting too much of the heavyweight-ness of it.
Basically this script set up a child server and is meant to be executed
whenever a remote/child server is taken out to a clinic. Afterwards the
changes are synced back to the central/parent server and you can forget 
about it.
