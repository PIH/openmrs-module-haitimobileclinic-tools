Naive attempt to automatically re-create the metadata from the main zanmi server.
Didn't work really well (most because of reports), but this was used once 
together with some manual 'pimping' to get the relevant parts of the metadata.
From there one the database has evolved separately. 

Still keeping this here for reference purpose and to maybe reuse parts of the
work at one point.
